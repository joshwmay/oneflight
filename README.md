# oneflight
A repository housing a website created over the course of a single five hour flight.

I plan on creating a website during a single flight in order to convey basic skills that could be utilized by an organization with shifting focuses or updates to their services. 

I will refrain from using anything from previous projects, and attempt to employ javascript features in order to create something that can be used as a tool. 

Some ideas I have for what I hope to build:
   1) A budgeting site that could be used to generate VBA coding that could be pasted into excel to create a personal budget
   2) A site that explains how to record and save macros in excel and also provides useful macro encoding
   3) A site focusing on the use of Pandas in Python
   4) A site purely focused on CSS and csszengarden.com
